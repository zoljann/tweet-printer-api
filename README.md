# Tweet Printer API

It utilizes Canvas for dynamic image generation, node-html-to-image for converting HTML to images, and Nodemailer for sending emails. These technologies work in tandem to enable features like generating product image previews based on tweet URLs and facilitating order management. Additionally, the backend integrates with PayPal for payment processing and MongoDB through Mongoose for database operations. Project is equipped with Swagger documentation available at /docs-api for easy API reference and documentation.
